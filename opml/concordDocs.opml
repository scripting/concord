			<outline text="Concord is a JavaScript outliner written by Kyle Shank in 2013, maintained by Dave Winer since, GPL-licensed.  "></outline>
			<outline text="The user interface is keystroke and mouse-compatible with the Living Videotext outliners, ThinkTank, Ready and MORE, and the outliner built into UserLand Frontier and Radio UserLand. "></outline>
			<outline text="There's a new release in February 2020, the first since 2013. "></outline>
			<outline text="Concord is the core component of &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/&quot;&gt;Little Outliner&lt;/a&gt; and numerous other of Dave's projects. "></outline>

			<outline text="You can see the work notes &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/concord/blob/master/worknotes.md&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. "></outline>
			<outline text="I've been adding features carefully and slowly over the years. "></outline>
			<outline text="The biggest change is that Concord is now managed using the same tools I use for all my other &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting?tab=repositories&quot;&gt;projects&lt;/a&gt;, so it will be easier to publicly release new versions. "></outline>
			<outline text="The examples and writing on this site are from 2013, this update is a restoration of the original site, not a rewrite. "></outline>
